# ebird guessing game

This app is currently online at http://cicindela.net

This is a web app that shows a random eBird checklist, with missing information (the month, county, or 1 species), and asks the user to figure out which species is missing. It is currently only set up to use Ontario checklists, but could be readily modified to support custom regions and I may do so in the future.
